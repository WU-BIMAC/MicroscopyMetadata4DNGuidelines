Microscopy Metadata Specifications
----------------------------------
These specifications are being developed as a community effort initially led by the 4D Nucleome ([**4DN**](https://www.4dnucleome.org/)) Imaging Working Group (IWG) and the Bioimaging North America (BINA) Quality-Control and Data Management Working Group ([**QC-DM-WG**](https://www.bioimagingna.org/qc-dm-wg)) to extend the OME Data MOdel.
The next version of the Specifications are being developed in collaboration with the Quality Assessment and Reproducibility
for Instruments & Images in Light Microscopy ([**QUAREP-LiMi**](https://quarep.org/))

The proposed prefix for this namespace is **NBO** for 4d**N** **B**ina **O**me

Towards v02-01

The next version of the model will be the result of a community driven outreach effort that is currently underway.
