The NBO Microscopy Metadata Specifications were initially proposed by the 4D Nucleome ([4DN](https://www.4dnucleome.org/)) Imaging Standards Working Group (IWG) and by the Quality Control and Data Management Working Group ([QC-DM-WG](https://www.bioimagingna.org/qc-dm-wg)) of Bioimaging North America ([BINA](https://www.bioimagingna.org/)) to extend the OME Data Model, and are now being developed in collaboration with the Metadata Working Group ([WG7](https://quarep.org/working-groups/wg-7-metadata/)) of the Quality Assessment and Reproducibility for Instruments & Images in Light Microscopy ([QUAREP-LiMi](https://quarep.org/)) initiative.

NBO is the namespace for these specifications and it stands for 4D**N** **B**INA **O**ME
