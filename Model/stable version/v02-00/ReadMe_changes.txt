4D Nucleome (4BN) - Bioimaging North America (BINA) - Open Microscopy Environment (OME) Model
=============================================================================================

v02-00

This version of the model is a major overhaul with several important revisions that were introduced as a result of several months of evaluation, feedback collection and correction of v01.07 by the members of the BINA Quality Control and Data Management Working Group.

******************
Summary of Changes
******************

--> Introduced the sub-division of the initially proposed of the 4DN Extension of the OME model into three separate extensions:

1 - Core and Basic
2 - Advanced and Confocal
3 - Calibration and Performance

--> Simplified the Tier system from 5 to 3 tier levels.

--> Introduced Acquisition Software and Software Modules.

--> Introduced multiple new hardware components including:

- Apertures (Iris Aperture, Shutter, Phase Ring, PinHole, Diffraction Grating, etc.,)
- Optical Assemblies (Microscope Tube, Condenser etc.,)
- Optics Holders (Filter Wheel, Filter Slider, etc.,)
- Confocal Scanners (Spinning Disk, Raster Scanner, etc.,)
- Acousto-Optical Devices (AOBS, AOTF, etc.,)
- Electro-Optical Devices (Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter, Deformable Mirror, etc.,)

--> Introduced several improvements in the image acquisition settings model:

- Sample and Sample related elements (Sample Holder, Cover Glass, etc.,)
- Fluorophore and Immersion Liquid
- Several new Settings elements (MicroscopeTableSettings, PrismSettings, ShutterSettings, etc.,)
