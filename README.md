# NBO Microscopy Metadata Specifications

The community-driven [Microscopy Metadata Specifications](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/NBOMicroscopyMetadataSpecs) initially proposed by the 4D **N**ucleome ([4DN](https://www.4dnucleome.org/)) Imaging Standards Working Group (IWG) and by the Quality Control and Data Management Working Group ([QC-DM-WG](https://www.bioimagingna.org/qc-dm-wg)) of **B**ioimaging North America ([BINA](https://www.bioimagingna.org/)) to extend the **O**ME Data Model, and now developed in collaboration with the Metadata Working Group (WG7) of the Quality Assessment and Reproducibility for Instruments & Images in Light Microscopy ([QUAREP-LiMi](https://quarep.org/)) initiative
