description: The 4DN Microscopy Metadata Guidelines (4DN-Micro-Meta) is a tiered system of guidelines that was developed by the 4D Nucleome (4DN) initiative Imaging Standards Working Group for calibrating, describing and documenting microscopy experiments. In addition to extending the OME data model and maintaining full-compatibility with it, the main advance provided by the 4DN-Micro-Meta guidelines is to posit the subdivision of imaging experiments among a set of five Tiers representing increasing imaging and analytical complexity levels. As a consequence, these guidelines not only provide an OME-based comprehensive list of metadata key-value pairs that should be recorded, but also details which subset of the full list should be recorded depending on the specific Tier the experiment belongs to. In so doing the guidelines lie the foundation for the birth of a microscopy data standard that could serve the same purpose the Encode guidelines serve in the genomic community.
