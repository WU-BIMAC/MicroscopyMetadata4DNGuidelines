# Microscopy Metadata 4D Nucleome Guidelines
Adequate recordkeeping is essential for most experiments as it is necessary in order to evaluate results, share data and allow experiments to be repeated. Keeping notes on microscopy experiments should be relatively unchallenging in this regard, as the microscope is a machine equipped with a limited number of known parts and settings. 
In 2005 Goldberg et al. posited the first standard for imaging metadata Nevertheless, to this date no widely adopted set of metadata descriptors to be recorded or published with imaging data exists. 

Metadata automatically recorded by microscopes from different companies vary widely and pose a substantial challenge for microscope users to create a good faith record of their work. Similarly, the complexity and aim of experiments using microscopes varies leading to different reporting requirements from the simple description of a sample to the need to document the complexities of sub-diffraction resolution imaging in living cells and beyond.
Here we present a tiered system of guidelines for describing and documenting microscopy experiments developed by the 4DN Imaging Standards Working Group, a comprehensive list of metadata key-value pairs that should be recorded for each tier, a detailed explanation of why these values matter and a OME data model extension that captures these guidelines.

# Repository content
The proposed guidelines are available in four different formats:

1. An xsd file providing the XML-schema for the proposed OME extension.
2. A graphml providing an rendering of the INSTRUMENT Specifications and IMAGE ACQUISITION Settings sections of the model using the Entity-Relationship (ER) formalism. In order to open the file you can use the [yED applicaiton](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).
3. A PDF version of the same ER schema.
4. Finally, a table providing a comprehensive list of metadata key-value pairs that should be recorded for each tier can be found following [this link -->](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16IQl-K8UIStsdlkNzJTA7LzMCan9qyS3KKcmEJ5wu28/edit?usp=sharing)
